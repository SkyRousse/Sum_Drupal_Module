### Sum | Custom Module for Drupal 7

#### By Sky Rousse

The _Sum_ module takes the input of two numbers as submitted through a form implemented using Drupalâ€™s Form API. When the form is submitted, it returns the sum of the 2 numbers in a standard Drupal message on the page.

A link to the page containing the form is found as a normal menu item in the main menu.
